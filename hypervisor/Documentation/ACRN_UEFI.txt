Usage of acrn.efi
*******************

Suggest to follow the following step:
a. Build out the acrn.efi image with command "make PLATFORM=uefi".
b. Rename the original os loader file named bootloaderx64.efi that is located at \\EFI\\org.clearlinux\\ to bootloaderx64_origin.efi
which name can be user defined in the config file bsp/uefi/include/bsp/bsp_cfg.h, the default name is "EFI\\org.clearlinux\\bootloaderx64_origin.efi".
c. Copy acrn.efi to \\EFI\\org.clearlinux\\, and rename it to bootloaderx64.efi.
d. Update the bsp/uefi/clearlinux/acrn.conf file by filling the field <UUID of rootfs partition> with the your native rootfs partition uuid.
e. Copy bsp/uefi/clearlinux/acrn.conf to loader\\entries\\ directory.
f. Reboot.
g. If you want to recover to original os loader, just replace the bootloaderx64.efi with bootloaderx64_origin.efi.

Note:
There are two kind of DM memory allocation mechanism - CMA & Hugetlb, they can be choose but hugetlb will become default one.
- To support CMA, please make sure:
  a. add "cma=reserved_mem_size@recommend_memory_offset-0" like "cma=2560M@0x100000000-0" to the SOS cmdline in acrn.conf
  b. start acrn-dm without "-T" option
- To support Hugetlb, please refer to Documentation/ACRN_HUGETLB.txt
